# Streamlit-Chatbot-GPT-3.5-Turbo-Interaction

Crafted an intuitive chatbot interface with Streamlit, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model in Python. Users enjoy a seamless interaction, while a handy sidebar feature allows them to effortlessly wipe the chat history clean.

Employing shelve, the code ensures efficient storage and retrieval of chat history, contributing to a smooth and consistent user experience. The dynamic display of chat messages enhances the interface's appeal, providing a visually engaging and organized conversation flow.

The chatbot taps into the OpenAI API for real-time responses, elevating its conversational prowess. With a thoughtfully structured codebase, including a user-friendly delete history button, the interface prioritizes simplicity and user convenience.
